    """Entry widget to hold (usually) a single line of text.

    This widget was initially design to hold a single line
    of text. However, in our efforts to make data handling
    as close as possible to how Python works we thought
    that in some cases where single line strings are used,
    it might also be that, however rare, users want to use
    multi-line text instead. This is why, though designed
    for single-line editing, this widget also allows
    multi-line editing by pressing Ctrl-T.

    For instance, check this function call:

        function(**{key: value})

    Where 'key' must always be a string, but can be any
    string, including an empty one and also a multi-line
    one (one with one or more line separator characters).

    We don't know why Python allows this and we don't
    think this is bad design either, but since keys
    from dicts used in such way can indeed be multi-line
    strings as well, and we use entry widgets to
    represent such keys, it was only natural, given
    our desire to be as close as possible to Python
    design, that we also allow multi-line editing in
    the entry widget so that the user can add such text
    in that keys (and anywhere else) if so desired.

    Furthermore, Python doesn't make distinction between
    empty, single-line or multi-line strings, they are
    all the same type. We think this is an even stronger
    argument for allowing text editing of all kinds
    whenever strings are concerned.

    This is why we plan to merge the textbutton widget
    with this one, so that text editing of all kinds
    is encompassed in a single widget.

            can also be passed, in which case it means
            the loop holder will be the WindowManager
            class from the module winman.main.
        value (string)
            initial value of the widget.
        font_height (integer)
            desired font height in pixels.
        font_path (string, defaults to "default")
            represents font style. Check local
            font.py module for available styles. In doubt
            use 'default' for default font.
        width (integer)
            width of the widget.
        name (string)
            an arbitrary name to help identify the widget.
        command (callable)
            callable to be executed whenever the value
            changes at the end of an editing session.
        validation_command (None, string or callable)
            if it is None, the instance is set up so that
            no validation is done.

            If it is a string, it must be a key in a

            instance, the name of a built-in "str" method
            to use as the validation command.

            If it is a callable, it must accept a single
            argument and its return value is used to
            determine whether validation passed (when the
            return value is truthy value) or not (when it
            is not truthy).
        formatting_command (callable)
            It must accept a single argument, which is the
            string displayed in the widget, and its return
            value replaces such string in the final value
            of the widget.

            This callable will be used whenever the value
            in the widget is set with self.set.
        update_behind (callable)
            to be called every loop. Can be used to update

        draw_behind (callable)
            to be called every loop. Can be used to draw
            other widgets outside entry (useful when the
            objects outside the entry change their
            appearance over time or in response to the
            contents of this entry while you type).

        coordinates_value (2-tuple of integers)
            represents a position in 2d space; the values of
            x and y axes, respectively.
        foreground_color, background_color
            (tuple/list/pygame.color.Color instance)
            A tuple or list of r, g, b values which are
            integers ranging from 0 to 255. For the
            background color, an optional fourth value
            can be passed, which is an integer in the
