"""Facility for custom alpha masking class.

Module contents
===============

AlphaMask (class)
    custom class representing an alpha mask.


This modules contains a class which abstracts the setup and
operations of a mask. The instances of such class hold
both the original alpha values of the source surface and
also a copy of such values converted to floats in the unit
interval, enabling us to quickly use any of the techniques
described earlier.


Alpha Masking
=============

Alpha masking here refers to the operation of using the
alpha values of a surface into another. We call the surface
from which the alpha values are retrieved "source surface"
and we call the surface on which we are using the alpha
values "target surface". When this alpha masking is performed,
we say that the target surface had its alpha masked out.

Alpha masking is useful, for instance, to create stencils
for drawing specific shapes with varying colors or to limit
which part of a surface must be subject to an effect.
Though, at least at the beginning, we used this module
solely for stencilling.


Discussion: not using black and white images
============================================

It doesn't seem desirable to enable support for creating
masks from black and white images as sometimes is done
by other software.

If we were to implement such feature, pure black would
represent 100% transparency and pure white would be 100%
opacity (and greys would be the values in-between).

This means an image loaded as a pygame.Surface would not
need an alpha channel anymore to convey transparency and
thus we would be able to use .jpg images to create masks.

However, this method offers no apparent advantages over
using .png images with alpha channels. It is true that
surfaces without alpha channels, converted with
pygame.Surface.convert() are faster to blit than
surfaces with alpha channels converted with
pygame.Surface.convert_alpha(), but blitting has nothing
to do with alpha masking.

Additionally, even if images without alpha channels were
loaded faster, which we haven't tested, such advantage
wouldn't be relevant to the masking out operations, which
are carried out several times during the lifetime of the
mask, whereas loading is only performed once.

Furthermore, even if loading speed became an issue,
waiting a bit more at startup to pre-load the masks would
still be more desirable than working with the black/white
format which, although simple, isn't as straightforward as
working directly with transparency in .png files.
