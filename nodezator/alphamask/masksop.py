"""Facility w/ operations between masks for AlphaMask class.

Module contents
===============

AlphaMaskOperationsBetweenMasks (class)
    class used as an extension for the AlphaMask class;
    it contains operations one can perform between 02 or
    more masks.

Besides the class defined here, there are also other
functions to support the class' operations, which are
pretty self-contained and will be presented in their
own docstrings rather than here.


Class operations
================

The operations between masks presented here are akin to
common arithmetic operations performed between numbers.
The difference is that the numbers are the alpha values
(either in their full or unit form) from different masks.

In other words, the operating between masks consists of
taking the alpha values of the instance and those of other
given masks and applying operations on the alpha values
situated at the same position, generating a new alpha
value for each position. For regular operations, these
new values are used to return a new masks and, for the
in-place operations, these new values replace the original
values in the instance performing the operation.

    ### methods for operating on full alpha values and

    ### their partial implementations;

    ## notes about the partial implementations:
    ##
    ## the max() operation and its in-place version is
    ## good to combine different masks into one, like
    ## obtaining an union of the masks' areas;
    ##
    ## the min() and multiply() operations, and their
    ## in-place versions, are good to obtain the area of
    ## intersection between masks;
    ##
    ## the subtract() operation and its in-place version is
    ## good to obtain the area representing the difference
    ## between the given masks;
