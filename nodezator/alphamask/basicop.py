"""Facility w/ basic operations for AlphaMask class.

Module contents
===============

AlphaMaskBasicOperations (class)
    class used as an extension for the AlphaMask class;
    it contains basic operations for AlphaMask instances.


Class operations
================

Both the mask_by_replacing() and mask_by_multiplying()
methods can be used to mask out the alpha of a surface
received as their sole argument. They use the first and
second techniques of alpha masking, respectively. Such
techniques are explained further below in the next section.

The get_colored_surface() method receives a color and returns
a new surface filled with that color and with the alpha
masked out using one of the existing techniques we just
mentioned, whichever is most suitable depending on whether
or not the color used has any transparency to it.

The class also has a method to return a new pygame.Rect
representing the dimensions of the source surface, the
get_rect() method. The size of that surface is also stored
in the "size" attribute. The source surface itself isn't
stored anywhere, since we are only interested in its alpha
values and size.

The masking operations carried out in this module are 
different from the ones carried out by pygame.mask module 
because pygame.mask only deals with bitmasks (a pixel is 
either fully opaque or fully transparent), while the mask 
operations here doesn't rely on bitmasks and work with
pixels in all ranges of transparency, (fully opaque, fully
transparent and partially transparent pixels).

We use 02 different techniques of alpha masking here, both
suitable for different situations:

1) The first one, the most simple, consists of assigning
   the alpha values of the source surface to the target
   surface. That is, each alpha value is used as-is.

   In practice, we don't spend time retrieving the alpha
   values of the source surface, because this is step
   is performed much earlier and the alpha values are
   stored so they can be used/reused whenever needed.
   That is, when masking out, we only need to worry about
   applying the alpha values to the target surface.

   This first technique is assumed to be faster than the
   second one, because this technique only uses a subset
   of the steps used in the second one.

   Technique 1 is best suited for usage in target surfaces
   which only have solid colors, that is, surfaces whose
   all alpha values equal 255.
   
   This is usually so because source surfaces usually have
   their visible area (or at least most of it) rendered with
   solid colors (alpha is 255) and when such values are
   applied in target surfaces with semitransparent areas
   such areas would then be rendered solid.
   
   In other words, if the target surface had alpha values
   different than 255, they would be reverted back to the
   full 255 alpha value, that is, the alpha of the source
   surface would cause semitransparent portions of the
   target surface to appear as having solid colors, which
   may be undesirable.

   In yet another words, think of this operation as one
   that completely ignores the original alpha information
   of the target surface by replacing it with the alpha
   from our mask, whereas the technique 2, as we'll soon
   see, does take into account the alpha information of
   the target surface.

   Whether technique 1 or 2 is better suited for the
   mask operation we are planning to perform, it all
   ultimately depends on what we want to achieve, so
   there isn't really an absolute better technique.

   When we apply the technique 1, we say that we
   are replacing the alpha of the target surface.

2) The 2nd technique converts the alpha values from the
   source surface into floats in the unit interval (real
   numbers from 0.000... to 1.0) and multiply them by the
   respective alpha values of the target surface. Only then,
   after the result is rounded to the nearest integer is
   that the resulting alpha value is assigned to the target
   surface.

   When such multiplications are carried out, the pixels of 
   the target surface whose alpha are multiplied by 0 
   become completely transparent. Naturally, the pixels
   whose alpha is multiplied by a number between 0 and 1
   retain only a percentage of its original alpha value.
   and those whose alpha is multiplied by 1 don't have
   their alpha value altered.

   This technique isn't as fast as the first one since
   instead of just assigning the alpha, we have the extra
   steps of multiplication and rounding described earlier.

   Like the first technique, we also retrieve the alpha
   values of the source surface in anticipation and also
   convert them to floats in the unit interval, leaving
   the values stored so they can be used/reused whenever
   needed. This way, when applying the alpha values from
   the source surface, we only need to worry about the
   multiplication and rounding step.

   This technique is suitable for usage in any kind of
   target surface, regardless of whether it has
   semitransparent areas or not, because it doesn't cause
   semitransparent portions of target surfaces to become
   solid.

   In other words, this technique takes into account the
   original alpha values of the target surface.
   
   However, when dealing with target surfaces that only have
   solid colors, the first technique is preferable, since it
   achieves the same effect with less steps.

   When we apply the technique 2, we say that we
   are multiplying the alpha of the target surface.

    ### masking methods;
    ###
    ### you'll notice that instead of having 02 masking
    ### methods, we could have a single method with 02
    ### functools.partialmethod implementations by
    ### encapsulating the alpha processing/assigning step
    ### (performed inside the "for loops") into specific
    ### functions;
    ###
    ### this way we wouldn't need to repeat the first and
    ### last lines of code in both methods, which are the
    ### same;
    ###
    ### we decided against this, though, since putting the
    ### code from the "for loops", which is executed several
    ### times, inside a function, would introduce undesired
    ### speed loss;
    ###
    ### that is, sometimes, to speed up execution of Python
    ### code, it is better to "inline" the code instead of
    ### encapsulating it in a function, specially when
