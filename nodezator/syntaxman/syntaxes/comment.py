### main function definition

## Check the "No syntax errors" section in the docstring
## of the function below to know why it isn't expected
## to raise SyntaxMappingError

def get_comment_syntax_map(comment_text):
    """Return dict mapping portions to respective categories.

    That is, we map each portion of the text to the name
    of the category that portion represents in the syntax.

    Comments only have two categories, which are normal
    text ('normal') and todo words ('todo_words').

    How we map the text is based on the behaviour observed
    in the vim editor, which highlights todo words within
    comments. Such todo words are the words TODO, XXX and
    FIXME.

    The dict itself contains indices of lines from the text
    mapped to another dict which contains the intervals in
    that line mapped to the category of text each interval
    contain.

    The intervals are 2-tuples of integers representing
    the [a, b) interval. Another way of seeing such
    integers is as the indices you'd use to grab the
    slice of text from the line representing the interval:
    line_text[a:b].

    For instance, if a line has the (0, 4) interval mapped
    to 'normal', it means the line text has normal text
    from the index 0 until the index 3. If you were to
    execute line_text[0, 4] you'd get a normal portion
    of text.


    Doctest
    =======

    An example in the form of a doctest can be seen below:

    >>> text = "### TODO hello world"
    >>> expected_output = {
    ...   0: {
    ...        (0, 4)  : 'normal',
    ...        (4, 8)  : 'todo_word',
    ...        (8, 20) : 'normal',
    ...      }
    ... }
    >>> get_comment_syntax_map(text) == expected_output
    True

    In other words, the output means that the text we
    provided, in its first line (index 0), has normal
    text from the index 0 until the 3 and then has
    text representing a todo word from the index 4
    until the index 7, then normal text again from
    index 8 until the index 19.


    No Syntax Errors
    ================

    This function wasn't set to raise SyntaxMappingError
    as was the case for the equivalent function which maps
    syntax for Python source code, for instance.

    This is so because comments don't have wrong syntax.
    They either have special syntax ("todo" words) or no
    syntax at all, but we don't expect any syntax-related
    errors to be raised while mapping syntax for comments.

    Parameters
    ==========
    line_string (string)
        represents a line of text.
    index (integer)
        the index of a character in the line string.

    Purpose
    =======

    Used to check whether a "todo" substring (a string
    from the TODO_WORDS constant) from line_string is
    a proper todo word.

    Such check is made indirectly, by checking the
    characters which reside in the adjacent indices
    of the substring. The following rules apply:

    A character sitting on an adjacent index is valid
    if either...

    a) it doesn't exist (not having an adjacent character
       is a valid condition for a todo word)
    b) it exists and is considered an allowed character
       (it must be in the ALLOWED_SURROUNDING_CHARACTERS
       string)

    For the substring to be considered valid, both the
    adjacent indices must be checked, which is why this
    function is called twice: one call per index.
    """
    ### in this context, if the index is negative, it means
    ### it doesn't exist, which is a valid condition, so
    ### we return True
    if index < 0: return True

    ### check whether the index points to a character in
    ### the line string
    try: char = line_string[index]

    ### if it doesn't, since this is a valid condition we
    ### pass in order to meet the 'return True' statement
    ### at the end of the function
    except IndexError: pass

    ### if there is such character, we check whether it
    ### is not allowed, in which case we return False

    else:

        if char not in ALLOWED_SURROUNDING_CHARS:
            return False

    ### if we reach this point, it means we didn't meet an
    ### invalidating condition, so we can return True
