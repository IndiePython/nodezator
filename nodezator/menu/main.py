# XXX whenever convenient, implement new changes in

### XXX small bug on popup submenus: try 'summoning' a
### pop up menu in a spot on the screen, then get out of it
### using the mouse right click instead of the left click
### and then summon it again using the right click!
### A submenu of the popup menu will appear in the previous
### spot it was (that is, it seems its as if its position
### isn't updated);
###
### in other words, it seems I must not only update the
### position of the menu when summoning it, but also of the
### submenus as well; at least that's what it seems to be
### the problem; investigate;


### XXX because of how the body of the menu may have an
### outline and the body of submenus all have a depth
### finish, the left/up arrows are positioned with a
### small offset so the arrow isn't blitted over such
### outline/finish; however, the scrollable items of the
### menu sometimes are blitted over it, depending on their
### position; this is neither urgent nor really much
### incovenient, however, after other higher priority
### tasks are performed, schedule time to solve this;


class MenuManager(
      BehaviourDefinitions,
      HoveringOperations,
      Scrollability,
    ):
    """Manages menus, their its items and subitems.

    This class, along with the classes used for composition
    (Menu and Command) were design to work together to
    reproduce a behaviour similar to the one observed in
    tkinter.Menu widgets.

    The menu manager works as a container for other
    menu-like items and/or their subitems. Such items and
    subitems consist of (sub)menus and commands.

    The menu manager structure, is a tree-like structure,
    which starts with the MenuManager instance as the
    root and always end up in a command:

         Menu - Menu - Command
        /
    MenuManager - Menu - [...] - Command
        \
         Command

    For instance:

         File (menu)
         /    > Open (command)
        /     > Open recent... (menu)
       /      > Close (command)  |
      /                          |
    MenuManager                   > Open file 01 (command)
       \   \                      > Open file 02 (command)
        \   \
         \   Edit (menu) > Preferences (command)
          \
           Undo (command)

    As you can see, the MenuManager object can have both
    menu.submenu.main.Menu and menu.command.Command objects
    directly attached to it. Menu objects, on the other hand,
    can have other menus attached to them, or a command
    object.

    However, if you aim to use the menu manager as a
    menubar, don't add commands directly to it, but first
    attach Menu objects and only them put commands on them.
    There's no technical need to do so, it is just an
    usability measure, because it seems users expects the
    words on a menubar to refer to submenus, not commands
    (for instance: file menu, edit menu, which people
    expect to have commands and submenus under them, not
    for themselves to be commands).

    However, the ability to have commands added directly
    under the menu manager has a purpose: do so if you
    intended to use the menu manager as a popup menu.
    In that case, the user won't have a problem with popup
    menus having commands on them, because that's pretty
    usual for popup menus.

    If a widget has other widgets attached to it, then those
    widgets are considered its children, and are stored in
    the 'children' attribute. This is true for both the
    MenuManager and the Menu classes.

    Each widget also has a 'parent' attribute wherein they
    store a reference to its parent widget, except for the
    menu.main.MenuManager instance, since it works like a
    root for the structure, being the highest parent.

    A menu or command whose parent is the MenuManager
    (instead of other menu object) is called a top item
    (also a top menu or top command, depending on its type).

    When the mouse hovers of a top menu and left-click, its
    children become visible and we say that the menu is
    expanded. Before that, when no child of a top menu is
    visible, we say that the top menu is collapsed.

    The default behaviour is for all the top menus to be
    collapsed. Once a top menu is expanded, all submenus
    which are hovered automatically expand, without the
    need to left-clicking them.

    The branch or hierarchy of the top menu and all its
    items and subitems until the last expanded menu is
    called the active branch.

    Only the children, grandchildren, etc. of a single top
    menu can be visible at a time, that is, only one top menu
    is expanded at a time, while all the others are collapsed.

    Of course, all this expanded/collapsed discusion doesn't
    apply to commands, since the concepts don't apply to
    them, since they don't have children.

    In the future other widgets may be added, possibly as
    subclasses of Command:

    1) a checkbutton menu item whose invocation toggles a
       boolean (and changes its surface to show whether the
       boolean is toggled or not).
    2) a separator widget should be added, too, for better
       layout/aesthetics/usability. Such separator would
       probably be just a widget like Command but with no
       effects nor highlighted surfaces just the surface of
       a line with a slight depth.

    Commands should also be further developed in the future
    to have a normal/disabled states, which should probably
    be controlled by a custom callable passed to them which
    returns a boolean.

        Parameters
        ==========

        menu_list (list of dicts)
            contains data about menu manager items. Each dict
            in the list represents an item which can be a
            command or a submenu with more items.

        loop_holder (any python object with handle_input,
            update and draw methods)
            the loop holder related to this instance, the
            one to which the menu manager should give focus
            once it gets out of focus itself.

        draw_behind (callable)
            callable used to draw objects behind the menu.
            Defaults to a function which draws a cached
            copy of the screen over the screen.

        boundaries_rect (pygame.Rect instance)
            provides a limit which should be respected by the
            menu.

        coordinates_name (string)
            represents an attribute name of a pygame.Rect
            instance wherein to store the position
            information from the coordinates value parameter.

        coordinates_value (2-tuple/list of integers)
            position information in the form of a tuple or
            list containing integers representing the
            coordinates in the x and y axes, respectively.

        is_menubar (bool)
            Defines whether the top menus should be side by
            side (True) or on top of each other (False).
            In other words, this defines whether the menu
            manager is being used as a menubar or as a
            context menu. All the children submenus and so
            on are always on top of each other, regardless
            of the value of this argument.

        horiz_bg_width (integer; defaults to 0)
            width of background. If 0, will use sum of
            children's widths. Can never be bigger than the
            screen's width. Only relevant if is_menubar
            == True. Also, only affects the menu manager,
            since the regular menus always respect only
            the boundaries_rect provided.

        vertical_bg_height (integer; defaults to 0)
            height of background. If 0, will use sum of
            children's heights. Can never be bigger than
            the screen's height. Only relevant if menu
            manager is not a menubar. Also, only affects
            the menu manager, since the regular menus
            always respect only the boundaries_rect
            provided.

        use_outline (boolean, defaults to False)
            if True, an outline is drawn using the rect
            attribute every loop. Use this when making a
            popup menu, to make constrast between the menu
            manager and what is behind it.

        keep_focus_when_out (boolean, defaults to False)
            defines whether to keep the focus when the
            mouse isn't hovering any meaning object in the
            menu manager and there's no active branch.
            It should be set to True only when using the
            menu as a popup menu, for improved usability.
