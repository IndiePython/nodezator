### Note about font height

For font_height values exceedingly big, the menu manager
might not behave appropriately or even when it does it might
be difficult to pick menu items on the screen. This is due to
clamping issues.

Clamping is the operation of keeping a rectangle within
another rectangle, in this case the menu inside the
screen or whichever boundaries you set for the menu.

With extremely big values, clamping becomes difficult to
handle. This doesn't make the application crash nor makes
it slow. It just makes the menu items hard to place on the
screen.

There's no need to worry about it though, since, as I said,
this just applies to really big and unreasonable font height
values, like font heights above 113, which I've never seen
used for any menu in any application.

I even managed to use the menu with font heights bigger than
113, when stress testing, but it also depends on the length
of individual labels and structure of the menu. And, of
course, I'll say it again, I can't imagine the need to use
a font height that big.

I'd say the ideal would be to keep the menu between font
height 17 and 26. My favorite setting is font height 17.
However, the ideal value also depends on the font used
and the user's preference/need.
