        dy (integer)
            represent how much to move in y axis.

        collapse_expanded_child (boolean, defaults to True)
            defines whether or not the expanded child must be
            collapsed when scrolling. It is True when used
            normally, that is, when autoscrolling by hovering
            the scroll arrows, so the expanded child
            collapses.

            If we don't collapse the body of the moving
            expanded child when autoscrolling the arrows we
            would have to add extra complexity to the code
            in order to control/predict the position of the
            moving body.

            We deem such complexity unnecessary because we
            assume that when users scroll the menu they do
            so in order to reach something which isn't
            visible, otherwise there would be no need to
            scroll. Thus, getting rid of the excess of what
            is visible (the body of the expanded child)
            shouldn't cause any problem.

            There is, though, a scenario wherein we don't
            collapse the body of the expanded child (that
            is the parameter is set to False: only when
            scrolling using the mousewheel. This is so
            because it would otherwise be confusing/
            unpleasant to have the expanded body suddenly
            vanish when scrolling the menu with the mouse
            still hovering the child.

            When scrolling the menu with the mousewheel,
            the child may still collapse though, even with
            this argument being False, that is, when the
            menu scrolls, the child changes its position and
            other child may end up being hovered by the
            mouse, in which case the now unhovered child
            will naturally collapse. This is a desired
            effect.

            This parameter and its effect is not a
            requirement though, but rather an usability
            measure so the menu behaviour is more pleasing/
            less confusing.
