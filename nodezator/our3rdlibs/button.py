### XXX needs lots of refactoring and implementing
### extra interfaces (change surfaces according to state,
### etc.)


### XXX in the future, the constructor will receive
### three surfaces (one for each state: normal, hovered,
### pressed) and a tooltip text; the alternative creators
### should receive data in order to produce such surfaces;
### for instance, the "from_text" constructor would
### receive three tuples, each containing
### foreground color/background color values for each
### state; the "from_image" constructor should receive
### background colors too, and the name of an image
### with transparency, so that you can use the different
### background colors; the "from_image" should maybe
### receive a shape argument helping define the shape
### of the button (for instance, circular, etc.) so that
### the background is blitted accordingly; I could also
### use a lru_cache for storing surfaces resulting from
### commonly used settings;
