        Quick discussion
        ================

        Instead of arbitrarily creating/referencing/copying
        the checkered surface, I could first check whether
        the surface has transparency or not, so the step
        could be skipped if it didn't have.

        However, after trying the implementation, it wasn't
        obviously apparent whether or not this would save
        a significant amount of time (or even whether it
        would save time any time at all), since so many
        operations take place. For instance, even taking
        the speed of the operations into account, this
        class was made, at least initially, to produce
        relatively small widgets, thus not much time is
        spent in the creation of surfaces to begin with.

        In the future, when convenient, we could profile
        such operations within typical use-cases in order
        to decide whether to implement the additional checks
        and operations to skip checkered surface creation/
        copy when the color has no transparency.

        For now, I believe the method is fine as it is
        and doesn't hinder the application at all.
