        Note that, during the editing session, the color

        Parameters
        ==========

        color_value (special value)

            if an special value, it must be an object
            representing one or multiple color values;

            it may be in different formats:

            1) a tuple of RGB(A) values (integers so that
               0 <= integer <= 255), representing a
               single color;
            2) a string representing a color in hex
               format using '#ffffff' or '#ffffffff'
               format, representing a single color;
            3) a tuple in which each item represents a
               color; such items must all be in the
               format specified in either the item 1)
               or item 2), never both.

        color_format (string)

            either 'rgb_tuple', if individual colors
            must use the representation described in
            the item (1) of the 'color_value' parameter
            explanation above or 'hex_string', if the
            format in item (2) must be used instead;

        alone_when_single (boolean)

            when True, instead of a tuple of colors, the
            color itself is used as the value when the
            color value represents a single color (that is,
            when True, if only one color is stored, it will
            be either a string or a tuple of integers
            representing a single color, instead of a tuple
            containing such color);

            for instance, for
            color_format='hex_string' and
            alone_when_single=True, say the value of the
            button is ['#ffffff', '#00ff00aa'], if you
            go and delete any color (for instance, the
            second one), instead of ['#ffffff'] as the
            value of the button, you'll end up with
            '#ffffff' (that is, the string itself).
