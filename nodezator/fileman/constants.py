### sizes/positions

### XXX instead of being fixed as they are now, it would
### be cool if the toplefts of the panels were defined
### dynamically based on the position of the objects that
### lie above them; as things are now, if someone ever
### desires to change the size of the file manager, it
### would also be necessary to change the toplefts
### (which is something simple enough, but could be further
### improved); similarly, the width of the panels could
### be defined as fixed percentages of the file manager's
### width;
###
### edit: an even better solution: after finishing other
### tasks of higher priority in the app, make it so the file
### manager measures/positions are defined dynamically
### just like we did with the splash screen;
