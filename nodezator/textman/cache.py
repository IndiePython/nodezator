"""Facility for text surfaces storage and sharing.

This module provides 02 objects of interest for when
we want to reuse text surfaces. The other objects are
support objects not meant to be imported/touched in
any way.

The ones you want to import are:

1) The TextSurfacesDatabase instance called TEXT_SURFS_DB,
   which is created and stored at the end of the module;

     This one is a dict which, given a dict containing
     text rendering settings (the dict is internally
     converted to a hashable representation),
     automatically creates another dict containing
     a surface map and a width map.

     Both the surface map and width map are dicts which
     associate text to surfaces and the width of such
     surfaces, respectively. They are stored in the
     'surf_map' and 'width_map' keys.

     Such maps and their values are always created
     automatically by passing the required keys, so you
     never need to check if a map has some item.

     This is an example of its usage:

     text_surf = (
       TEXT_SURFS_DB[text_settings]['surf_map'][text]
     )

     In other words, here we obtain a cached text surface
     for the given text and its rendering settings. It
     means everytime we do this it will return the same
     surface for that text, thus saving memory whenever
     we want to reuse the same surface over and over again,
     instead of creating a new ones as it is the case
     when using textman.render.render_text().

     For instance, the text editor does this to ensure all
     equal characters in the text use the same text
     surface. However, the text editor doesn't do so
     directly, using the mechanism we just showed in the
     example above, but does so using the CachedTextObject
     class, which we'll present next.

02) The CachedTextObject class

      A Object2D subclass which instantiates objects with
      a text surface and respective rect. This class is used
      to automate the creation of objects which use cached
      text surfaces.

      In other words, the example given in the item above
      explaining the usage of the TEXT_SURFS_DB object
      is performed internally in this class so it always
      obtains cached text surfaces for its 'image' attribute,
      just needing to instantiate a new pygame.Rect object
      for its 'rect' attribute.

      To obtain a new instance, you just need to pass the
      text you want plus the text settings.

      new_instance = CachedTextObject(text, text_settings)

        Profiling note
        ==============

        I measured the speed of this method both with and
        without the "if block" in a context where the text
        settings were constantly changed between different
        settings. We did so by decorating this method with
        appcommon.debug.measure_average_speed function. We
        used 4, 100, 1000, and 10000 repetitions.

        It turned out, unexpectedly so, that the solution
        with the "if block" made the method quicker when
        the number of repetitions where 4, 100, 1000. The
        speed was about 10% faster.

        We expected all experiments to yield results
        favorable to the solution without the "if block",
        since we know every time the "if check" was
        performed, it came out negative and ended up
        executing the rest of the method anyway, so it
        was just an unnecessary step.

        Only when the repetitions were 10000 the solution
        without the "if block" performed better, but it
        isn't that relevant, cause this method is intended
        to not be repeated so much in a short amount of
        time, so the results with a small number of
        repetitions are assumed to be more useful.

        This needs further investigation, but it shall be
        postponed for a number of reasons:

        1) Counter-intuitive as they may be, the numbers
           still indicate we should keep the "if block";
        2) I don't know enough of Python internals to be
           able to effectively understand why the results
           were like so;
        3) Though speed is important, I have more urgent
           and important tasks to which to attend;
        4) I need a more systematic way to profile code,
           store the results and manage the resulting
           knowledge, so that the profiling experiments
           I run occasionally all contribute together to
           understand profilling and keeping my code as
           quick as it can be without sacrificing
           maintainability/readability; (though in a way,
           this point is related to the point 2).
