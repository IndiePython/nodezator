        Discussion
        ==========

        We don't worry about moving the cursor (nor the
        visible lines) vertically, because the visible lines
        have their vertical positions fixed and characters
        are very often all of the same height.

        There might be, though, rare cases where a character
        has a height different than that of the vast majority
        of other character.

        We didn't address this possibility yet, because on
        top of being rare, the slight difference in height
        might not be enough to justify adjusting the position
        of objects vertically.

        That is, the character might still be visible enough
        to be comfortably identified by the user editing the
        text.

        Even so, further measures should be taken in the
        future if problems arise. Until the last time this
        method was update, there never was a case where
        such possibility was observed or was a concern
        otherwise.
