        """Perform syntax highlighting setups.

        Depends on the requested syntax highlighting,
        which might also be an empty string, meaning
        syntax highlighting must be disabled.

        Requesting the highlighting of a syntax which is
        not available has the same effect as passing an
        empty string.

        If syntax highlighting is enabled, we also attempt
        to highlight the text at this step. Check the
        update_syntax_highlight_data() and
        syntax_highlight_visible_lines() methods to see
        how this happens.

        Parameters
        ==========

        font_path (string)
            indicates the font style to be used when
            editing the contents; defaults to ENC_SANS_BOLD_FONT_PATH,
            which uses the normal font of the app; you can
            use FIRA_MONO_BOLD_FONT_PATH, to edit text in monospace font
            (to edit code for instance).
        syntax_highlighting (string)
            represents the name of a syntax used to
            highlight the text (for instance, 'python');
            if an empty string, or the name of an
            unsupported syntax is given, syntax highlighting
            is disabled;
            if, otherwise, the argument indicates a
            supported syntax, syntax highlighting is
            enabled and we use it to highlight the text
            when rendering it;
            even when the syntax highlight is enabled,
            though, the highlighting may fail, for instance,
            if there's a syntax error in the text; in such
            case, the text is rendered with no highlighting
            at all, but highlighting goes back to normal
            once the syntax problem is solved;
