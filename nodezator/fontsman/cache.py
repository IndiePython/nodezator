"""Facility for pygame.font.Font objects storage/sharing.

This module provides 01 object of interest for when
we want to reuse font. The other objects are support
objects not meant to be imported/touched in any way.

The one you want to import is:

The FontsDatabase instance called FONTS_DB, which is
created and stored near the end of the module;

   This is an example of its usage:

   font = FONTS_DB[font_path][size]

   In other words, here we obtain a cached image surface
   for the image in the given path, rendered according to
   the given image settings.

    Or as close as possible without surpassing it.

    The font object is a pygame.font.Font instance.

    This is achieved by trial and error, that is,
    instantiating fonts and using their 'size' method.
    This is so because each font has a different ratio
    between the size provided and the height in pixels
    of its rendered text surfaces. Such ratio even
    changes within the font itself depending on the
    specific size used.

    Since instantiating pygame.font.Font and using its
    'size' method is very quick, this is fast enough as
    to not be noticeable.

    Furthermore, this is done only once per font and
    desired height, since the resulting font object
    is stored for future reference (as can be seen in
    the get_font function).

    Coming up with a font which renders text surfaces
    of the exact desired height is not always possible.
    This is why sometimes we have to use the one which
    gets closer.

    For instance, you cannot have a pygame.font.Font
    from an "ubuntu medium" font file with surfaces of
    height 36. This is so because such font, when
    instantiated with size 31 renders surfaces of
    height 35 and when instantiated with size 32
    renders surfaces with height 37.

    In such case, we'll use the closest one which doesn't
    surpass the desired height, that is, the font with
    surfaces of height 35.
