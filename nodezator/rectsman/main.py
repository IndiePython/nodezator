"""Facility with class providing rect-like behaviour.

This module provides two important objects used to make
any instance containing multiple rects to behave as if it
had a single rect.

The first object is a property with a getter and setter
to be injected in custom classes as the "rect" attribute.

The second object is a class whose purpose is to manipulate
multiple pygame.Rect instances at once."""

    This class has the same basic API of pygame.Rect found
    in the online docs (except for the constructor, the
    __init__ method), which means instances of this class
    can be manipulated just like pygame.Rect instances.

    Additionally, since this class has the same basic
    pygame.Rect API and it can manipulate pygame.Rect
    instances, it can also manipulate instances of itself,
    nested or not.

    Check the "doctests" directory to find extensive
    documentation and doctests regarding the usage of
    this class.

    Such documentation also has a discussion regarding a
    future/possible redesign, which keeps the pygame.Rect
    API compatibility but has even more flexible behaviour
    and also new ones beyond the pygame.Rect API.

    For now, there is only two methods provided which are
    beyond the pygame.Rect API, which is the '__iter__'
    method from the 'special.py' module (even though the
    pygame.Rect is compatible with iteration in Python
    via its __getitem__ method) and the 'snap_rects'
    method from the 'align.py' module.
