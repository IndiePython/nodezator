## log level
LOG_LEVEL = DEBUG

## number of log files kept; they are called backups, and
## each one represents a run of the software until the
## user closes it (or when the file size nears the maximum
## size in bytes defined in the next constant);
BACKUP_COUNT = 30

## maximum size in bytes of the log files;
##
## whenever a log file gets close to this size, a new log
## file replaces it and it becomes a rotated file (called
## a backup log) and its contents are rotated (transfered)
## through a log file backup hierarchy;
##
## bear in mind, however, that we mean to keep each log
## file containing only records for a single run of the
## software whenever possible and this size limit was
## provided just for safety, to prevent the log to grow
## indefinitely large in case something goes wrong;
##
## that's why we use a value purposefully higher than what
## we expect a common session to produce in size, though we
## don't have data enough to determine such number
## accurately; thus, this value will be adjusted in the
## future when we have enough data to decide on a value
## closer to reality;
##
## however, even if a log file reaches its limit and
## rotates, thereby no longer representing a full session
## (since new records for the current session will still
## be produced and logged in the new file), it is not a
## problem per se, since the python-like format we use
## allows us to easily identify if/when a log file rotated
## before reaching the end of the session, thereby allowing
## us to easily determine to which session each record
## belongs;
