### XXX idea: make it possible to reload individual node
### scripts (you can use the category + script_dir to reach
### to it directly; such information can be easily retrieved
### from the dict in APP_REFS.node_def_map);
###
### think about the implications of that operation in
### dependencies like nodespaces (in the file) and node
### groups (in the available operations) which use the
### reloaded node scripts (since we assume the reason for
### reloading it is that fact that it changed, and probably
### the dependencies must take it into account, since a new
### module_obj is generated);
###
### edit: thinking about it, this might not be needed,
### since, even if the objects generated don't have the
### same id (from id()), the callable will still have the
### same id attribute

### XXX
###
### I believe errors in the node scripts and also other
### problems, like a missing 'nodes_directory' field in
### the native file (or even a 'nodes_directory' which
### points to a folder with no node scripts) can all be
### solved from a common "design point":
###
### the node editor could have a "data view" mode,
### where crucial parts of the native file data could be
### exposed so that such kind of problems
### could be addressed, or at least leave the
### app in standby while the user goes where
### lies the problems and solve them (for instance,
### fixing a node script if it has an error in it,
### etc.); the ability to reload a node script is
### also appreciated, as discussed in the
### graphman/scriptloading.py module already mentioned;
###
### edit1: as of now, some poka-yoke checks were implemented
### to guide the user through eventual issues they may
### have with the nodes directory, until a more elegant
### solution can be properly designed and scheduled for
### implementation;
###
### edit2: though the poka-yoke checks were meant to be
### temporary until we come up with a better solution, this
### doesn't mean they are not a solution good enough
### (a better solution may in fact not even exist, or be
### too complex to be worth the time required to
### implement/teach it, or not even be needed);


### TODO review docstring;
###
### - add description of id_map;
### - I believe we don't store the script's text, as
###   said in the docstring, but rather the location
###   to that text (path); check and fix docstring if
###   needed;
