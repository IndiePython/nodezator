    """Create surface for text block from given text.

    The surface is created by rendering the lines of text
    one by one, then blitting them all into a single surface,
    one below the other.

    Parameters
    ==========

    text (string)
        text for the text block.

    Syntax-related error handling
    ===============================

    At the very beginning of the function's body we
    create the text objects representing the comment.
    Such text may have special highlighting according
    to whether special contents are present in the comment.

    In some cases, an operation to render highlighted
    text like the one in this function is guarded by
    try/exception clauses to prevent from errors when
    mapping the syntax.

    We don't do so here, because comments don't have wrong
    syntax. They either have special syntax ("todo" words)
    or no syntax at all. Thus, the probability of syntax
    related errors resulting from the contents of the
    comment doesn't exist.
