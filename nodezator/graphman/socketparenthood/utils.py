"""Utility functions for line segment management.

The clipping utilities in this module were based on the
so called Cohen Sutherland algorithm:

https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cohen%E2%80%93Sutherland_algorithm

The code was based on code from this page:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
line-clipping-set-1-cohen-sutherland-algorithm/

The page attributes the contribution to Saket Modi and
further references the wikipedia article we just mentioned
above.

The code was further refactored and commented by me

### clipping utilities

## when drawing line segments, we want to draw as little as
## possible, thus we only draw the portion of the segments
## which are inside the screen, that is, we clip the
## segments to the visible area; however, since the segments
## have some thickness, we compensate by using a rect just
## a bit larger than the screen for the clipping, specially
## since the size of the clipping area doesn't slow down
## the calculations
CLIPPING_AREA = SCREEN_RECT.inflate(4, 4)

## the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm used to clip line segments
## defines 9 conceptual regions/areas which it uses to define
## whether clipping is needed based on the position
## of points in those regions (the central region is the
## collision area); here we define codes that represent
## the different sides of the clipping area; combined, they
## represent the 9 different regions
