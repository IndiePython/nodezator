    The given color_value can be in different formats which
    are explained below. If the function returns without
    raising a ValueError, than we can say the the color
    value is a valid color representation. This is to say
    that this functions can also be used to validate
    color values, not only to retrieve the specific info.

    Parameters
    ==========
    color_value (string or tuple)
        value representing a color or tuple of colors;
        it can be:

        - a string in hex color format:
          e.g.: '#ff0000' or '#ff0000ff'
        - a tuple of integers from 0 to 255 where
          each integer represents the red, green, blue
          and/or alpha channel of a color.
          e.g.: (255, 0, 0) or (255, 0, 0, 255)
        - a tuple populated with strings or
          tuples in the formats presented above
          (you must use the same type for all values)

          e.g.:

            ('#ff0000', '#00ffffee', ...)

            or

            ((255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 255, 255), ...)

    Return value
    ============

    The return value is a 2-tuple with the following values:

    index 0: name of the format of the color value

       e.g.:

         'single_hex'   for '#ffffff'
         'multiple_hex' for ['#ffffff', '#ff0000', ...]
         'single_rgb'   for [255, 0, 0]
         'multiple_hex' for [[255, 0, 0], [0, 0, 255], ...]

    A custom algorithm (though I prefer using the word
    "recipe" here) is used based on what we believe to
    be a good way of organizing a somewhat large list of
    colors.

    Parameters
    ==========

    colors (list of colors)
        colors are sequence of integers; such integers
        are in the range(256) and represent the values
        of the red, green and blue channel of a color;

        a fourth integer may also be present, representing
        the value for the color's alpha channel, but we
        don't consider it to be relevant for our sorting
        operation, so it is not taken into account.

    Alternative implementation
    ==========================

    Just thought it would be interesting to mention that
    this function could also be implemented as a
    function to use as the key of list.sort or the
    "sorted" built-in function, instead of returning
    a new list as we in this function.

    However I think presenting the steps as done in this
    function makes it easier to understand and maintain
    this function.

    Nonetheless, the alternative implementation is not only
    interesting, but it also takes only 60% (roughly) of
    the time the current implementation takes to sort the
    colors (maybe cause the current implementation creates
    a new list). The alternative implementation can be
    found below just after the definition of this function,
    commented out.
