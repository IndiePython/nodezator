"""Facility for rendering icons from fonts.

That is, here we deal with font and related data to render
text surfaces of single characters, treating such characters
as icons. No actual surfaces are returned from the
functions in this module, only the font and the bounding
rect (the cropped area occupied by the character in the text
surface).

Check this problem to understand why rendering single
characters as icons is important:

    if we wanted to render the plus sign ('+') as text, the
    resulting surface would be too tall and similar to a
    rectangle in portrait position, because it would be
    rendered as a letter; the font height we provide would
    be used for the entire surface, rather than for the
    plus sign itself.

This is why this module exists. Now we can render surfaces
containing only the icon, having control over the dimension
we desire (either 'width' or 'height') of the surface.
