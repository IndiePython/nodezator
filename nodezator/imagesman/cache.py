"""Facility for image surfaces storage and sharing.

This module provides 03 objects of interest for when
we want to reuse image surfaces. The other objects are
support objects not meant to be imported/touched in
any way.

The ones you want to import are:

1) The ImageSurfacesDatabase instance called
   IMAGE_SURFS_DB

     This is an example of its usage:

     image_surf = IMAGE_SURFS_DB[image_path][image_settings]

     In other words, here we obtain a cached image surface
     for the image in the given path, rendered according to
     the given image settings.

02) The CachedImageObject class

      A Object2D subclass which instantiates objects with
      an image surface and respective rect. This class is
      used to automate the creation of objects which use
      cached image surfaces.

      new_instance = CachedImageObject(
                       image_path, image_settings
                     )

03) the update_cache_for_image() function;
