### those should be added either on .git/info/exclude,
### which is specific to each local repository, or
### to a .gitignore file on your user folder, which is
### considered for all your repositories if you set the
### "core.excludesfile" config to its path like this:
### git config --global core.excludesFile '~/.gitignore'
###
### for instance, if you use VIM, you may want to add
### the following rule to your .gitignore file, like I
### did, since I use VIM (don't uncomment, this is just
### a demonstration):
### *.swp
