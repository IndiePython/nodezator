# examples_node_pack

A node pack with example nodes, just for demonstrating how to create different kinds of widgets/nodes

They have no other dependency. Just open Nodezator, create a new file and select this folder with the menubar command **Graph > Select node paths**

The nodes have no purpose beyond being used as demonstrations. They do not represent all possibilities regarding widget options, but they are great for beginners.

Also, in case you didn't know it is possible, you can see the source of any user-defined node by selecting it and pressing **<i>**. So if you want to know how any node from this node pack was created all you need to do is create it, select it and press **<i>** to see its source code.
